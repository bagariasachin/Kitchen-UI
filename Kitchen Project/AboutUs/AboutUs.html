            Pioneered by Mr. Shubham and Mr. Mayank in 2000 as PK Marketing, the
            company revolutionised the way Nagpurians looked at the cooking
            space. It wasn’t long before the concept took Vidarbha by a storm
            and business grew exponentially. PK Marketing soon started creating
            their place in the marketplace of modular kitchens and other
            furniture. Their close associations with leading architects,
            interior designers and builders of the city opened doors to a
            flourishing business. The firm made a name for itself in the market
            because of their excellent service, innovative products and good
            management. From the traditional carpenter and his age-old designs
            to computer-designed 3D models, Paradise Kitchens changed the face
            of the cooking arena in many households. Besides having a huge
            Showroom at mumbai with a display space of 3000 sq. ft., the company
            boasts of two showrooms in Pune having a total display space of more
            than 3000 sq. ft. All the showrooms have a huge display of Kitchens
            & Home furniture too. A well-established dealer network in the
            entire Vidarbha, Marathwada, Pune& Bangalore region generates good
            business. Over the years, The Paradise Kitchen has regularly
            introduced newer designs and products in the market, making it a
            leader in the modular kitchens industry along with a good reputation
            in the UPVC windows and doors market. The Paradise Kitchen has tied
            up with prestigious international companies like Hafele, Nagold,
            Aristo and Lingel for different verticals.
