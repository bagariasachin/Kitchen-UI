                "PVC is a multi-purpose material and finds its application
                virtually everywhere, e.g. Shoes, Clothes (like water and
                wind-resistant jackets), Credit Cards, Electricity, Sewer and
                Water pipes, etc. Hence it is ideal for the production of Doors
                and Windows. Un-Plasticised Polyvinyl Chloride (uPVC) is a
                specially formulated PVC which has been made resistant against
                the ultraviolet rays of the sun. This keeps the material in new
                condition even after many years of usage. Today almost 50% of
                windows and doors in Europe are made from uPVC. They have a
                proven track record of customer satisfaction and provide
                essential components for a sustainable future. In addition to
                all this, uPVC windows help greatly in heat reduction, sound
                insulation while being durable, easily maintainable and
                eco-friendly. "
